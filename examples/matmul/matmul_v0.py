Naive Matmul
************

This tutorial demonstrates a simple implementation of matrix multiplication using Tilus. We hope to use this example
to illustrate the basic concepts of writing a kernel in Tilus, including kernel definition, data types, tensors, and
usage of tilus kernel.

# Tilus Script
# ============
# In Tilus, we define a kernel by subclassing the :class:`tilus.Script` class. There are two methods
# that we need to implement: ``__init__`` and ``__call__``.
#
# - The ``__init__`` method is used to initialize the compilation-time known hyperparameters of the script.
# - The ``__call__`` method is the main entry point of the script, where we define the computation logic of the kernel.

        self,
        # compilation-time known hyperparameters

        ...  # process the hyperparameters

# Naive Matmul Implementation

# This naive implementation is not optimized for performance, but it serves as a good starting point to understand the
# basic concepts of Tilus.

# %%
# We used three type annotations for the kernel parameters:
#
# - ``int32``: a runtime-known 32-bit integer, which is used for m_size.
# - ``int``: a compile-time known integer, which is used for n_size and k_size. Different values of n_size and k_size
#   will trigger Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation of the kernel.
# - ``~float16``: a pointer to a float16 array, which is used for a_ptr, b_ptr, and c_ptr. It is equivalent to
#   `float16*` in C/C++.
#
# .. currentmodule:: tilus.Script
#
# We also used the following tilus instructions in the kernel:
#
# - :meth:`global_view`: to create a global tensor view of the input matrices A and B.
# - :meth:`register_tensor`: to create a register tensor to accumulate the results of the matrix multiplication.
# - :meth:`load_global`: to load a block of matrix A and B into register tensors.
# - :meth:`dot`: to perform the dot product of two register tensors.
# - :meth:`cast`: to cast the accumulated result to float16 type.
# - :meth:`store_global`: to store the accumulated result back to the output matrix C.
#
# All of these instructions are defined with **block** semantics, which means that they are executed by all threads
# in a thread block.

# %%
# Launching the Kernel
# ====================
# To launch the kernel, we need to create an instance of the `MatmulV0` class and call it with the appropriate
# parameters. The following code demonstrates how to do this:
import math

import pandas
import torch
from tilus.utils import benchmark_func


def main():
    headers = ["m", "n", "k", "name", "latency (ms)", "tflops"]
    workloads = [[4096, 4096, 4096]]

    rows = []
    for m, n, k in workloads:
        # create an instance of the kernel we have just defined
        matmul = MatmulV0()

        a = (torch.rand(m, k, dtype=torch.float16).cuda() - 0.5) / math.sqrt(k)
        b = (torch.rand(k, n, dtype=torch.float16).cuda() - 0.5) / math.sqrt(k)
        c_actual = torch.empty(m, n, dtype=torch.float16).cuda()
        c_expect = a @ b
        torch.cuda.synchronize()

        # launch the kernel by passing required arguments
        matmul(m, n, k, a, b, c_actual)
        torch.cuda.synchronize()

        # check correctness
        torch.testing.assert_close(c_expect, c_actual, atol=1e-2, rtol=1e-2)

        # benchmark
        for name, func in [
            ("torch", lambda: torch.matmul(a, b, out=c_expect)),
            ("tilus", lambda: matmul(m, n, k, a, b, c_actual)),
        ]:
            latency = benchmark_func(func, warmup=5, repeat=20)
            tflops = 2 * m * n * k / latency * 1e-9
            rows.append([m, n, k, name, latency, tflops])

    df = pandas.DataFrame(rows, columns=headers)
    print(df)


# %%
# The above code creates an instance of the `MatmulV0` class and calls it with input sizes ``m``, ``n``, ``k``, and
# torch tensors `a`, `b`, and `c_actual`. The kernel is launched with the specified parameters,
# and the results are checked for correctness.

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

# %%
# The output of the above code will be a pandas DataFrame that contains the performance results of the naive matrix
# multiplication kernel. This naive kernel serves as a good starting point to understand the basic concepts of Tilus,
# but it is not optimized yet. In the subsequent versions of the matmul kernel, we will introduce various optimizations
# that can significantly improve the performance of the matrix multiplication and finally achieve the performance
# similar to the vendor libraries like cuBLAS.
